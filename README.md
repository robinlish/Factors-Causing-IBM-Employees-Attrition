# Factors-Causing-IBM-Employees-Attrition


I. Data Preparation:

##1. Download the original data from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset
###This is a fictional data created by IBM scientists to explore the factors that cause employeesâ€™ attrition, and to provide employers strategies in human resource. 
###It contains a total number of 1,470 employees, and 35 variables for each of them.


#II. Data Analysis:

##1. Do the analysis as in Module3 for categorical and numerical data. Show appropriate plots for your data:

###1.1 Analysis on Categorical variables:

####1.1.1 Show the frequencies of attrition and non-attrition employees:

####1.1.2 Show the proportions of attrition and non-attrition employees:

####1.1.3 Show the mosaic plot to compare the attrition proportion within different variables:

###1.2 Analysis on Numeric variables:

####1.2.1 Boxplot comparison:

####1.2.2 Histogram and distribution comparison:


##2. Pick one variable with numerical data and examine the distribution of the data.


##3. Draw various random samples of the data and show the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem for this variable.

```

##4. Show how various sampling methods can be used on your data.

###4.1 simple random sample without replacement:

###4.2 simple random sample with replacement:

###4.3 systematic sampling:

###4.4 Unequal Probabilities:

###4.5 stratified sample


##5. For confidence levels of 80 and 90, show the confidence intervals of the mean of the numeric variable for various samples and compare against the population mean.


###5.1  comparison of conf interval between different sample size:


###5.2 comparison between conf interval and pop mean:

##6. Test of Significance: Critical-Value Approach
